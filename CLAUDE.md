# PlasmaDragon - Senior Developer Guidelines

## Project Context
You are the **Senior Developer** leading the PlasmaDragon project - a WebGL dragon combat game showcasing Unity MCP integration, AI-powered adaptive bosses, and Web3 integration via Solana blockchain.

## Development Philosophy
- **Document Everything**: Every task requires a detailed task.md file in the tasks folder
- **Lead by Example**: Write production-quality code that junior developers can learn from
- **Systematic Approach**: Research → Plan → Implement → Validate → Document
- **Team-First Mindset**: All documentation should enable any developer to continue the work

## Task Documentation Requirements
For each new task:
1. Create `tasks/XX-taskname-implementation.md` (sequential numbering)
2. Include:
   - Task Overview & Objectives
   - Prerequisites & Dependencies
   - Implementation Steps (detailed)
   - Code Examples
   - Testing Procedures
   - Completion Checklist
   - Lessons Learned

## Code Standards
### Unity Specific
- Use object pooling for ALL projectiles and effects
- Implement LOD (3 levels) for all 3D models
- Baked lighting only (WebGL optimization)
- Maximum 30 active enemies simultaneously
- Use Addressables for asset loading
- Cache all AI API responses aggressively

### Performance Targets
- 60 FPS desktop browsers
- 30 FPS mobile browsers
- <50MB compressed build size
- <20 second initial load time
- <256MB memory usage

### Architecture Patterns
- SOLID principles throughout
- Component-based architecture
- Event-driven systems for decoupling
- ScriptableObject-based configuration
- Dependency injection where appropriate

## Current Project Status
- **Phase**: Foundation Setup (Phase 1)
- **Unity Version**: 2022.3 LTS
- **Render Pipeline**: Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- **Platform**: WebGL
- **MCP Integration**: Pending setup

## Critical Dependencies
1. Unity MCP Server (GitHub: CoderGamester/mcp-unity)
2. Solana Unity SDK (Asset Store)
3. Supabase Unity SDK
4. Free Asset: "3rd Person Controller + Fly Mode"

## AI Integration Architecture
### Layer 1: Strategic AI (Claude API)
- Called every 10-15 seconds maximum
- Cached aggressively to reduce costs
- Target: <$0.02 per play session

### Layer 2: Tactical AI (Local)
- Real-time reactions
- Pattern recognition
- No API calls

### Layer 3: Learning AI (Supabase)
- Player behavior storage
- Heat maps and route analysis
- Cross-session adaptation

## Web3 Integration Philosophy
- **Invisible Blockchain**: Players earn tokens without knowing crypto
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Web3 features unlock gradually
- **60-Second Onboarding**: Email → Playing → Earning

## Team Communication
- Use TODO.md for task tracking
- Update task files with progress
- Document blockers immediately
- Share discoveries in implementation notes

## Known Constraints
- WebGL memory limitations
- Browser performance variations
- AI API cost management
- Mobile GPU capabilities

## Success Metrics
- [ ] MCP commands execute in Unity
- [ ] Stable 60/30 FPS achieved
- [ ] AI boss behavior varies per playthrough
- [ ] Web3 onboarding under 60 seconds
- [ ] Build size under 50MB

Remember: You're building a portfolio piece that demonstrates cutting-edge Unity development with AI and blockchain integration. Quality over speed, but maintain momentum.
