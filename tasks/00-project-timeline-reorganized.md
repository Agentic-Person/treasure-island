## Critical Path Items
1. **MCP Setup** - Blocks all AI-assisted development
2. **Flight Controller** - Core gameplay depends on this
3. **AI Boss API** - Unique selling point #1
4. **Web3 Integration** - Unique selling point #2

## Risk Mitigation
- **API Costs**: Aggressive caching, local fallbacks
- **WebGL Performance**: Test builds every week
- **Time Overrun**: Cut landing page complexity, reduce enemy variety
- **Asset Integration**: Buy assets early (Week 1)

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Smooth 60 FPS dragon flight
- [ ] AI Boss makes different decisions each playthrough
- [ ] Tokens distributed without user knowing blockchain
- [ ] <50MB WebGL build
- [ ] <20 second load time

## Asset Purchase Plan
**Week 1 Purchases**:
1. **Dragon Model** (~$40-60)
   - Must have: Rigged, animated (fly, attack, idle)
   - Nice to have: Multiple texture variants
   
2. **Flight Controller** (~$30-50)
   - Must have: 3D flight, smooth camera
   - Nice to have: Mobile input support

**Total Asset Budget**: $70-110
