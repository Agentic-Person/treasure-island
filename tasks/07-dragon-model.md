## 🟡 REMAINING WORK (5% - Material Setup)

### 1. Material Fine-tuning - IN PROGRESS
**Current Issue:** Dragon appears with default/incorrect materials

**Available Assets:**
- ✅ Green Dragon textures (Unka Toon Green.png + Wings)
- ✅ Pre-made materials (4x3.mat, 07.mat)
- ✅ Normal maps for detail

**Required Actions:**
1. [ ] Apply Green Dragon textures to dragon model
2. [ ] Configure materials for body and wings separately
3. [ ] Set up proper material properties (albedo, normal, metallic)
4. [ ] Test material appearance in flight

### 2. Animation Integration - FUTURE
**Prepared for but not implemented:**
- [ ] Flying animations (wing flapping, banking)
- [ ] Idle animations 
- [ ] Transition animations
- **Note:** Not critical for current milestone

## 🚀 CURRENT CAPABILITIES

### ✅ What's Working Perfectly
1. **Dragon Flight:** Smooth, responsive controls
2. **Mouse Integration:** Natural look controls
3. **Roll Mechanics:** Banking turns feel realistic
4. **Camera System:** Professional third-person follow
5. **Testing Tools:** Real-time parameter adjustment
6. **Physics:** Stable rigidbody-based movement
7. **Scene Setup:** Clean, organized hierarchy

### 🎯 Immediate Benefits
- **Visual Impact:** Real dragon instead of test cube
- **Scale Reference:** Proper size for environment planning
- **Flight Feel:** Realistic dragon movement
- **Development Speed:** Unity MCP integration working
- **Quality Foundation:** Ready for combat and environments

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Flight Controller Configuration
```csharp
// BasicFlightController.cs - WORKING VALUES
[Header("Flight Settings")]
flightSpeed = 10f;           // Base movement speed
sprintMultiplier = 2f;       // Sprint boost
rotationSpeed = 100f;        // Turn rate

[Header("Mouse Controls")]  
mouseSensitivity = 2f;       // Mouse responsiveness
mouseSmoothing = 5f;         // Smooth mouse input
invertMouseY = false;        // Y-axis inversion

[Header("Roll Controls")]
rollSpeed = 50f;             // Roll rate
rollReturnSpeed = 30f;       // Auto-level speed
autoLevelRoll = true;        // Auto-return to level

[Header("Physics")]
drag = 2f;                   // Air resistance
angularDrag = 5f;           // Rotation damping
```

### Camera Configuration
```csharp
// CameraFollow.cs - WORKING VALUES
offset = new Vector3(0, 5, -10);  // Behind and above
followSpeed = 2f;                 // Smooth following
lookSpeed = 2f;                   // Smooth rotation
```
